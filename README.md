# Spring-HelloWorld

This is my first application in Spring. It is a simple HelloWorld Java console application using Springâ€™s application context.

To run this application:
- Clone & download this project.
- Run the "HelloWorldApplication.java" file found in the com.sagardafle package. 
- Check the console to see the output:  "Hello World from SagarDafle!"
- To change the authorname, change the username value in the "beans.xml" file found under the resources folder.
